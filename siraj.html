    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <h3>Definition of a Blog</h3>
    <p>A blog is an online journal or informational website displaying information in reverse chronological order, with the latest posts appearing first. It's often run by an individual or small group and updated frequently with new content.</p>

    <h3>Definition of a Website</h3>
    <p>A website is a collection of web pages and content that is identified by a common domain name and published on at least one web server. Websites serve a variety of purposes including business, personal, educational, or entertainment.</p>

    <h3>Why It’s Important to Know the Difference</h3>
    <p>Understanding the difference helps users and creators choose the right platform for their goals. Blogs are best for ongoing content while websites are better for static, business-focused information.</p>

    <h2>What is a Website?</h2>
    <h3>Core Components of a Website</h3>
    <p>Includes homepage, service pages, contact forms, and multimedia. Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and backend code.</p>

    <h3>Static vs Dynamic Websites</h3>
    <p>Static sites show fixed content, while dynamic ones fetch and display data in real time.</p>

    <h3>Purpose of a Typical Website</h3>
    <p>Used for presenting information, promoting products, showcasing portfolios, or enabling e-commerce.</p>

    <h2>What is a Blog?</h2>
    <h3>Blog Structure and Functionality</h3>

    <h3>Evolution of Blogging</h3>
    <p>From personal journals to professional tools for branding, SEO, and content marketing.</p>

      <li>Reader engagement through comments</li>
      <li>RSS feed integration</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key Differences Between a Blog and a Website</h2>
    <h3>Content Frequency and Updates</h3>
    <p>Blogs are updated often, websites remain largely static after launch.</p>

    <h3>Purpose and Audience Engagement</h3>
    <p>Blogs focus on interaction and providing value over time; websites focus on delivering essential business or brand info.</p>

    <h3>Design and Layout Comparison</h3>
    <p>Websites often have fixed pages. Blogs use a post feed layout, commonly with archives, categories, and recent posts.</p>

    <h2>Use Cases: When to Choose a Blog vs a Website</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Personal diaries or journals</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Hybrid Options</h3>

    <h2>SEO Differences Between Blogs and Websites</h2>
    <h3>How SEO Strategies Differ</h3>
    <p>Blogs require ongoing keyword research and regular updates; websites require structural optimization and targeted landing pages.</p>

    <h3>Fresh Content and Keyword Optimization</h3>

    <h3>Site Structure and Internal Linking</h3>
    <p>Websites use clear menus and navigation. Blogs rely heavily on tags, categories, and contextual internal links.</p>
